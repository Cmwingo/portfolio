              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                I am a bit of a nomad. I have moved around, both physically in the U.S., and in the job market. In college I had the brilliant idea to double major in Philosophy and Psychology. There's not exactly bright, or well defined, job prospects for someone with that particular training. Thus, I ended up working in many different sectors of the workforce.
              </p>
                My first job that I had in college was waiting tables to save up money to participate in my university's study abroad program. I believe everyone should work in some sort of customer service position at least once in their lives. If nothing else, it helps you appreciate what the people serving you have to go through every day and hopefully, you will treat them with kindness from that point forward.
              </p>
                After college I worked for a broadcasting company in the master control department. A dream job for a geeky kid. Just me and a room full of servers, network switches, and big monitors. Having no prior experience in this industry, I was apprehensive when I first started. Fear would grip me any time I had to touch one of the big glowing buttons. I was afraid to make any mistakes that might take down the video feed.
              </p>
                I picked up the job easily after a few weeks, and by the end of my five year stint there, I was fixing problems that the engineers were supposed to handle. Stepping into a role like that, completely green, and excelling in it, really gave me a lot of confidence in myself. After that, I wasn't afraid to branch out and just try something totally different.
              </p>
                My next job was in a completely disimilar field...wine. If you've ever talked to an oenophile, you might know that wine has a world all unto itself. The wineries in Arizona are just starting to come into their own. It was exciting to be involved in such an emergent industry with opportunities to gain experience in lots of diffent areas of the business. My main role was teaching people about wine and explaining all of the different blends and varietals that we offered in the tasting room. I learned so much!
              </p>
                I mentioned earlier my rather naive approach to college, but I did actually have the foresight to minor in computer science. Which brings us to the present. I have always loved computers, video games, and really all things electronic. However, in college my attention turned to the humanities and economics. My world view expanded rapidly, and I had to brace myself against all the new information I was being made aware of. My childhood love of gadgets and video games seemed insignificant against the weight of the world.
              </p>
                After slogging through that philosophical morass for far too many years, and having since realized that I'm not going to solve the world's problems by sitting around and thinking about them, I've decided to renew my love affair with technology. And what better way to kick it off than with Epicodus!
